# Lec13 - Piping `%>%`, 5MV#1 `filter`ing, and 5MV#2 `summarize()`

## Piping

* R Command: `%>%`
* Pronounced: "_then_"
* Keyboard shortcuts:
    + macOS: COMMAND+SHIFT+M
    + PC: CTRL+SHIFT+M


## Piping

Piping allows you to

1. Take the output of one function and **pipe** it as the input of the next
1. You can string along several pipes to form a single **chain**
1. See Chalk Talk



<!--
## Piping

Ex:  say you want to apply functions `h()` and `g()` and then `f()` on data `x`.  You can do

> * `f(g(h(x)))` OR
> * `x %>% h() %>% g() %>% f()`


## Important Concept: Piping

This

> * saves you from confusing nested parentheses
> * emphasizes the **sequential** breaking down of tasks, making it more readable
> * i.e. Do this _then_ do this _then_ do this _then_ ...


## Important Concept: Piping

Pipes are always directed to the first argument of any function. The following three bits of R code
do the same thing: extract all january flights:

```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)

# Bit 1: No piping
filter(flights, month == 1)

# Bit 2: Piping. Note no comma
flights %>% filter(month == 1)

# Bit 3: Piping across multiple lines (preferred for legibility)
flights %>% 
  filter(month==1)
```
-->



## Today: Five Main Verbs

> 1. **`filter()` rows/observations matching criteria**
> 1. **`summarize()` numerical variables**
> 1. `group_by()` group rows/observations by a categorical variable
> 1. `mutate()` existing variables to create new ones
> 1. `arrange()` rows



## 5MV#1 Filter

`filter()` rows/observations matching criteria

<center>
<img src="assets/figure/filter.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;"/>
</center>



## Filter Example

Take `flights` and then filter for all rows where `year` is equal to 2014. 

Note we use `==` and not `=`

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)

flights %>% 
  filter(year == 2014)
```



## 5MV#2 Summarize

`summarize()` numerical variables using a _many to one_ function:

<center>
<img src="assets/figure/summarize1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;"/>
</center>


## 5MV#2 Summarize

Examples of _many to one_ functions:

* `sum()`: sum of n values
* `mean()`: mean of n values
* `sd()`: standard deviation of n values
* See backside of cheatsheet -> Summarize Data -> Summary functions



## Summarize Example

What's going here?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
data(weather)

weather %>% 
  summarize(mean_temp = mean(temp))
```

# Lec12 - Mon 3/13: Intro to Data Wrangling

## Switching Gears

With the internet, we are in a new age of data:

![](assets/figure/DataDeluge.png)



## Bridging the Gap

> * Jenny Bryan at UBC teaches a graduate level class <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://stat545.com/">STAT 545</a> on **Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R**. Note the ordering.
> * <img src="assets/figure/gap.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 500px;"/>



## Classroom vs Real Data

Jenny Bryan said: *"Classroom data are like teddy bears and real data are like a grizzly bear with salmon blood dripping out its mouth."*

Traditional Classroom Data            |  Real Data
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="assets/figure/teddy.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  |  <img src="assets/figure/grizzly.gif" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Real Data

Some attributes of real data:

* Often not in a format ready for analysis
* Messy and needs cleaning
* Typos, weird outliers
* Missing values
* Inconsistent formatting



## Real Data

Inconsistent formatting is a real pain:

> * Dates: "2016/10/12" vs "2016-10-12" vs "10/12/16" vs "10/12/2016" vs "Oct 12, 2016"
> * "DC" vs "D.C." vs "District of Columbia"
> * "Beyonce" vs "Beyoncé"



## dplyr Package

To take this, we now officially introduce the `dplyr` package: a grammar of data manipulation

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/figure/dplyr.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>
</p>



## Pedogical Note

* Were it not for this package, I probably wouldn't be taking a data-centric view to this course.   
* The **verb** describing the action you want to perform on your data **IS** the name of the `function()` you use.
* So you don't need extensive programming experience (indexing, for loops, etc) to be able to manipulate data.




## 5MV

Say hello to the 5MV: the **five main verbs**

1. `filter()` rows/observations matching criteria
1. `summarize()` numerical variables
1. `group_by()` group rows/observations by a categorical variable
1. `mutate()` existing variables to create new ones
1. `arrange()` rows


Also, later `_join()` two separate data frames `by` corresponding variables

# Lec11 - Thu 3/9: 5NG#5 Barplots

## Today

> 1. ~~Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot~~
> 1. ~~Line-graph~~
> 1. ~~Histogram~~
> 1. ~~Boxplot~~
> 1. **Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph**


## Barplots

Recall from first Grammar of Graphics lecture, we displayed

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
# Bar Chart
babynames %>% 
  mutate(decade = round(year / 10) * 10) %>% 
  filter(name=="Hayden" | name == "Carlos" | name == "Ethan") %>% 
  filter(decade >= 1990) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(n=sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(x=name, y=n)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x="Name", y="Count", title="Name Counts since 1990")
```


## Exercise

Say these piecharts represent polls for a local election with 5 candidates at time points A, B, and C:

<img src="assets/figure/piecharts.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 550px;"/>

Answer the following questions:

* In the first race, is candidate 5 doing better than candidate 4?
* Who did better between time A and time B, candidate 2 or candidate 4?


## Exercise


<img src="assets/figure/barplots.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;"/>



## Barplots

* **y-axis**: Both histograms and barplots display notions of relative frequency/counts
* **x-axis**:
    + Histogram: continuous variable
    + Barplot: **categorical** variable
* `geom_bar()` is the trickiest of the 5NG, so we'll use it in limited capacity.


## Chief Difficulty with Barplots

Two different ways to have counts show on y-axis:

> * Computed internally by `geom_bar()`
> * Precomputed manually by yourself in your `data` in a variable `count`, `n`, etc.


## Example

Counts **are not** pre-computed:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- data_frame(`Row Number`=1:5, name=c("Albert", "Albert", "Albert", "Mo", "Mo"))
knitr::kable(x)
```



## Example

Counts **are** pre-computed in variable `n`. So `n` becomes a `y` aesthetic variable!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# Lec09 - Thu 3/2: 5NG#4 Boxplots

## Today

> 1. ~~Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot~~
> 1. ~~Line-graph~~
> 1. ~~Histogram~~
> 1. **Boxplot**
> 1. Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph


## Example

If I know your name, I can guess your [age](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/). Looking at the handout answer the following questions:

As of Jan 1st, 2014 in the United States

> 1. What can you say about females named Ella vs Zoe?
> 1. What can you say about males named Aidan vs Oliver?
> 1. What proportion of male Connors are younger than 16? 
> 1. What proportion of female Gertrudes are older than 69?

## Statistics Terminology

* The $p^{th}$ **percentile** means p% of observations fall below it.
* Ex: If 30 years old is the 40th percentile of age, then 40% of people are 30 or younger.
* The horizontal bars indicate the 3 **quartiles**
    + 1st quartile = 25th percentile:
    + 2nd quartile = 50th percentile AKA median. It is a measure of **center**.
    + 3rd quartile i.e. 75th percentile
* The width of the bars (3rd quartile - 1st quartile) is the **interquartile range (IQR)**
    + It contains the middle 50% of observations.
    + It is a measure of **spread/variability**.
    


## Boxplots

**Chalk Talk**:  <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/113th_United_States_Congress">Age of 544 Members of 113th United States Congress</a>:

> * 439 members of House of Representatives
> * 105 Senators


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)

current_congress <- congress_age %>% 
  filter(congress == 113) %>% 
  mutate(party=ifelse(party=="D", "Democrat", ifelse(party=="R", "Republican", "Independent")))
ggplot(current_congress, aes(x=party, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```


## Why Boxplots?

* The babynames example of today are boxplots **without the whiskers**
* Boxplots, just like histograms, show distributions. But IMO they are better for comparing multiple distributions with a single line.
* Ex: [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/03/19/394057221/how-much-or-little-the-middle-class-makes-in-30-u-s-cities) article. In this case,
you can compare cities with a single vertical line.

# Lec08 - Wed 3/1: 5NG#3 Histograms + Facets

## Today

> 1. ~~Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot~~
> 1. ~~Line-graph~~
> 1. **Histogram**
> 1. Boxplot
> 1. Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph


## Recall

From `okcupiddata` package, the `profiles` data set:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(okcupiddata)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Histogram
profiles %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x="height (in inches)", y="count", title="Heights of San Francisco OkCupid Users")
```


## Recall

Restricted to heights between 55 (5'5'') and 80 (6'8'') inches:

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Histogram
profiles %>% 
  filter(between(height, 55, 80)) %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x="height (in inches)", y="count", title="Heights of San Francisco OkCupid Users")
```


## What Histograms Do

> * The y-axis displays notions of **relative frequency** i.e. which values 
occur more than others.
> * Huge definition: they are a visualization of the **statistical 
distribution** of values.


## How Do I Construct Them?

> * We have an `x` aesthetic
> * Counts on the y-axis not an explicit variable in the data set, but rather are 
computed internally. i.e. No `y` aesthetic
> * The shape of a histogram is dependent on the **structure of the bins** on the x-axis.


## Chalk Talk:

For values: $-2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5$

Let's draw histograms using the following binning structures:

> 1. (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)
> 1. (-4, -2, 0, 2, 4)
> 1. (-4, 4)


## Facets

Facets allow you split *ANY* plot by a categorical variable. In this case by adding
`+facet_wrap(~sex)` to the `ggplot()` call

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Histogram
profiles %>% 
  filter(between(height, 55, 80)) %>% 
  ggplot(data=., aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x="height (in inches)", y="count", title="Heights of San Francisco OkCupid Users") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

# Lec07 - Mon 2/27: 5NG#2 Linegraphs

## Today

> 1. ~~Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot~~
> 1. **Line-graph**
> 1. Histogram
> 1. Boxplot
> 1. Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph


## Recall Example Data

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create data frame
simple_ex <-
  data_frame(
    A = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("Hot", "Hot", "Cold", "Cold")
  )
simple_ex
```


## Example 

A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes()`thetic
attributes of `geom_`etric objects.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data=simple_ex, aes(x=A, y=B, size=C, color=D )) + 
  geom_line()
```

<!--
## Smoothers

Smoothing is a technique that allows us to separate the "signal" from the "noise."

In this [example](http://www.quantdec.com/Excel/Exhibit5.png):

> 1. The dots are the raw data
> 1. The blue and red lines are smoothers: they pick out the overall **trend**
> 1. The blue curve is a "smoother" smoother in that is isn't as variable


## Smoothing Techniques

There are two general techniques for smoothing:

> 1. A straight line: overall trend
> 1. A wiggly line: local trends
-->








<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# Lec06 - Fri 2/24: 5NG#1 Scatterplots

## Today

> 1. **Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot**
> 1. Line-graph
> 1. Histogram
> 1. Boxplot
> 1. Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph


## Today

What's not great about this plot, especially near (0, 0)?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
all_alaska_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(carrier == "AS")
ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights, aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Departure Delay", y="Arrival Delay", title="Departure/Arrival Delays for Alaska Airlines 2013 NYC Flights")
```


## Overplotting

This is called overplotting: when points are stacked so densely we can't see what's going on!

There are two ways of dealing with this:

1. Make points a little more transparent
1. Jiggle the points a little

# Lec05 - Thu 2/23: More 5NG

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```


## Refresher: The Grammar of Graphics

A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes()`thetic
attributes of `geom_`etric objects.


## Refresher: 5NG

The **five named graphs** we'll see in this class. Note: I reordered them from last time to be easiest to hardest to work with:

> 1. Scatterplot AKA bivariate plot
> 1. Line-graph
> 1. Histogram
> 1. Boxplot
> 1. Barplot AKA Barchart AKA bargraph


## Data Visualization via ggplot2 Package

* We are building up to doing data visualization in R via the `ggplot2` package
* Last time we reverse-engineered the grammar from graphical outputs
* Today we (forward) engineer them


## Today's Data

In tidy format: 

```{r}
simple <-
  data_frame(
    A = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("Hot", "Hot", "Cold", "Cold")
  )
simple_ex %>% kable(format="markdown")
```

library(okcupiddata)
```

## What is a statistical graphic?

* Today we kick off Topic 2.b) **Data Visualization** by asking ourselves: What is a statistical graphic?
* But a brief lesson from military history first


## Napoleon's March on Russia in 1812

In 1812, Napoleon led a French invasion of Russia, marching on [Moscow](https://goo.gl/maps/geRyXH3rJcK2).  

<center><img src="./assets/figure/napoleon.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 350px;"/></center>


## Napoleon's March on Russia in 1812

It was one of the biggest [military
disasters](http://www.history.com/news/napoleons-disastrous-invasion-of-russia-200-years-ago)
ever, in particular b/c of the Russian winter.

<center><img src="./assets/figure/retreat.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 350px;"/></center>


## Minard's Illustration of the March

Famous graphical illustration of Napolean's march to/from Moscow

<center><img src="./assets/figure/Minard.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/></center>


## Minard's Illustration of the March

This was considered a revolution in statistical graphics because between

> * the map on top
> * the line graph on the bottom

there are 6 dimensions of information (i.e. variables) being displayed on a 2D page.


## The Grammar of Graphics

A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes()`thetic
attributes of `geom_`etric objects.


## Minard's Illustration of the March

Where? | **`data`** | **`aes()`**  | **`geom_`**
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
top map | longitude | **`x`** | **`point`** 
" | latitude | **`y`** | **`point`** 
" | army size | **`size`** | **`path`**
" | army direction (forward vs retreat) | **`color`** | **`path`**
bottom graph | date | **`x`** | **`line`** & **`text`**
" | temperature | **`y`** | **`line`** & **`text`**

# Lec03 - Mon 2/20: Tidy Data

## What is Tidy Data?

* There are many ways to organize data. Today we learn one way: the "tidy data" format.
* It is rather simple, but deceptively powerful.
* Equivalent to "long format"


## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>

1. Each observation forms a row
1. Each variable forms a column
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table



## What is Tidy Data (Advanced)?

1. Each observation forms a row: *In other words, each row corresponds to a single **observational unit***
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + *Some of the variables may be used to identify the **observational units**. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns*
    + *Some of the variables may be **observed values** associated with each observational unit*
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table: *Don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples with apples and oranges with oranges*



## nycflights13 Package

The [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package contains
"tidy data" all 336,776 flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in
2013.

To help understand what causes delays, it also includes a number of other useful datasets.

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names










<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# Lec02 - Thu 2/16: R Packages

## Exercise

In small teams, take 3 minutes to write down

1. A couple of male and female names that are "modern"
1. A couple of male and female names that are "old-fashioned"
1. One male and one female name that are "back in vogue"



## Learning R

* **Computers are stupid!** You need to:
    + Tell it exactly and everything it needs to do
    + Everything needs to be perfect:
        + Write everything from scratch
        + Names of "stuff" need to typed exactly
        + Parentheses need to match
* **Recall**: This is not a class on programming/coding. However, we'll learn just enough to do statistics and data science
* **Side Benefit**: Many of the concepts translate to almost all programming languages: python, javascript, etc.
    


## Learning R

Recall the tradeoff:

Less of this...            |  More of this...
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./assets/figure/formulas.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  |  <img src="./assets/figure/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>
    


## What are R Packages?

* **Base R**, i.e. R straight out of the box. It's fairly limited in power and functionality.
* **R Packages** are extensions to R that are
    + contributed by a world-wide community of R users
    + extend base R's functionality
    + are downloadable over the internet from RStudio.



## Step 1: How Do I Install a Package?

You need to **install** each package once.

* In RStudio: Go to Files Panel -> Packages -> Install
* Type in the package name and click install
* The procedure for updating a package is the same



## Step 2: How Do I Load a Package?

You need to **load** a package everytime you want to use it.

* Run `library(PACKAGENAME)` in the console.



## Baby's First R Packages

Today's Learning Check: Install and then load 3 packages:

* `dplyr`: a package for data manipulation
* `ggplot2`: a package for data visualization
* `babynames`: a package of baby name data



## `babynames` Package

The [`babynames`](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) package contains for each
year from 1880 to 2013, the number of children born of each sex given each name
in the United States. Only names with more than 5 occurrences are considered.

# Lec01 - Mon 2/13: Introduction

## Course Title

* In catalog: Introduction to Statistical Sciences
* New: Introduction to Statistical **and Data** Sciences



## What is Data Science?  {.flexbox .vcenter}

![](./assets/figure/data_science_1.png)



## Data Science

* Example domains: biology, economics, physics, sociology, etc.
* So why the title switch?



## Dialogue with Student 

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on?
I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

![](./assets/figure/dialogue_1.png)



## Course Objective #1

Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a
manner as possible while maintaining a level [suitable for
novices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346).  

* Cobb: Minimizing prerequisites to research
* Not necessarily publishing in top journals, but **answering scientific questions with data**.
* Difficult to do research without understanding stats, however



## Data/Science Research Pipeline

We will, as best we can, perform all this:

![](./assets/figure/pipeline.png)



## Data/Science Research Pipeline

And not just this, as in many previous intro stats courses:

![](./assets/figure/pipeline2.png)



## Course Objective #2

Foster a conceptual understanding of statistical topics and methods using 
[simulation/resampling](https://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/ResamplingUndergradCurriculum.pdf)
and real data whenever possible, rather than mathematical formulae.

* Whenever we can, use real data
* Example data set: [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)
* There are two "engines" that can make statistics "work"
    + Mathematics: formulas, approximations, etc
    + Computers: simulations, random number generation 



## The "Engine" of Statistics

In this course, computers and not math will be the "engine". What does this mean?

* Less of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/formulas.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>
* But more of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Programming/Coding

* Previous programming/coding experience **is not a prerequisite to this course**
* This course is not an explicit course on programming, coding, nor computer science. But we will use some elements. 
* Also you will be exposed to basic **algorithmic thinking and computational logic**
* Learning R is like learning a foreign language: its really hard at first!



## Two Simple Rules of Learning Code

* Computers are stupid!
* When learning, take existing code that works, and tweak it!



## Course Objective #3

Blur the traditional lecture/lab dichotomy of introductory statistics courses 
by incorporating more [computational and algorithmic
thinking](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Preprints/ComputingCurric3.pdf) 
into the syllabus.

* Completely separate lecture and labs is a legacy of a time before  
<img src="./assets/figure/laptop.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## RStudio Server

* Not all laptops are created equal: operating system, processing power, age
* RStudio Server: cloud-based version of RStudio where all processing is done on Middlebury servers
* [`go/rstudio/`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) (on campus or via VPN)



<!--
## Thursday Lab Time

**Undirected** time to

* Set aside to help people get up to speed with computing
* It is like learning a language.
* Learn from each other.
* Collaborate on problem sets (due on Fridays)
-->



## Course Objective #5

Develop [statistical 
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy) by, among other
ways, tying in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance
statistics plays in society.

* H.G. Wells (paraphrased): "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."
* Me: "Sure, it's easy to lie with statistics. But it's also hard to tell the truth without them."



<!--
## Data Visualization and EDA

* EDA = Exploratory data analysis
* **"Data visualization is a gateway drug to statistics."**
* Prez from Season 4 of HBO's "The Wire":
* <center><img src="./assets/figure/Prez.png" height="300px"/></center>
-->



## Final Project

* Capstone experience to align this topics and principles of this course with how research and learning is done in practice.
* Work on interpersonal and collaborative skills. No textbook on that!



## Lecture Format

Either

* **Lab format**: With laptop
    + You sit in groups of 4
    + I'll talk for 10-15 minutes before you work on learning checks
* **Chalk talk**: Old-school
    + Keep desk in rows
    + More traditional lecture format



## Let's Build our Toolbox

<center><img src="./assets/figure/tools.jpg" height="400px"/><c/enter>



## R, RStudio, and DataCamp

* R: Software behind the scenes i.e. **the engine**
* RStudio: Intergrated development environment i.e. **the interface**
* DataCamp: Browser-based learning tool i.e. **the driver's ed teacher**



## Analogy

R            |  RStudio |  DataCamp
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./assets/figure/engine.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>  |  <img src="./assets/figure/dashboard.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>  |  <img src="./assets/figure/instructor.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>



## Test Drive RStudio

> * Login to [`go/rstudio/`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/auth-sign-in) with your Midd account
> * If you don't have access, raise your hand. (Username: guest1, password: rstudioguest)
> * In RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Script



## The Four Panels

1. Console: Crunch numbers in R
1. Files, Packages, Help: See your files, install packages, help files
1. Editor: Where you'll write code and save it
1. Environment: Your workspace



## Important: Console

> * This is where you run/execute commands
> * The ">" is the prompt.  It means R is ready to receive commands
> * If you don’t see a ">" and want to restart, press ESC.



## Switching Gears

Now we will use R via DataCamp instead of via RStudio, but just for driver's ed. Two panels exist in both:

1. Editor panel: Where you write code
1. Console panel: Where you will execute code
